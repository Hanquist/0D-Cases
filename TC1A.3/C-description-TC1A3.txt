The prescribed initial conditions are:
 - Ttr=15,000 K
 - Tv =   300 K
 - Total number density 1e25 part/m3
 - Initially 79% N2 and 21% O2 by concentration
   (corresponds to 0.47907105936 kg/m3 with initial mass fractions of
   0.76708248854 and 0.23291751145 for N2 and O2)

Some choices made for this case:
 - Timestep is 1e-11 s to overresolve all processes, for the best comparison to other methods
 - Total time of 1 us yields essentially chemical equilibrium
 - Recombination is on and Zeldovich reactions have both the forward and backward processes enabled

-- Note on electronic energy
For a realistic CFD case at these (or similar) conditions, the specific heats would
   be set to include electronic energy excitation.
However, most of the other methods that this set is expected to be compared to
   may not be able to incorporate the effect of electronic specific heat.
Therefore, two sets of cases are included:
 - withEE includes the specific heat due to electronic energy included;
   the NASA Lewis polynomial fits describe the vibrational-electronic energy.
 - withoutEE does not include the specific heat due to electronic energy;
   an SHO approximation is used to describe the vibrational energy as function of temperature.
This choice does not directly affect the chemical kinetics calculation.

Two chemical kinetics models are used:
 - Standard Park (90 book, for example)
 - Modified Marrone-Treanor model with constant non-Boltzmann correction (MMT-NB),
   the best reference for this is currently Chaudhry's Scitech 2020 paper (AIAA 2020-2191)

A few notes about the MMT-NB model:
 - The correction factor of eta=16/3 is *not* applied to the O2+O dissociation rate
